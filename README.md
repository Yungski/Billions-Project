# Billions-Project
Taking a look at what makes Forbes Billionaires tick, what makes them who they are.
The data on the list of the Forbes Billionaires was an interesting course of study to find out what consistencies there are in their data.
To try and understand them while holding other factors constant, I could see that some were self-made while others were not. I could see others were married while others were single.
This led me to thinking that there could be a relation between the relative stability that marriage offers as most on the list are married to their wealth generation capacity.
Furthermore, I got to see that there is a high percentage of those who are self-made hence that could be a good avenue to venture for an aspiring billionaire.
The study does not take into account the different hard and soft skills that are unique to individuals such as communication and networking skills as well as innovative thinking, resilience and persistence
It does however offer a general overview on some critical factors that make up much of our present reality.
